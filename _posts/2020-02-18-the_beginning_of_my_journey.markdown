Programming is one of those fascinating subjects where you realize that the more you dive into it the more you realize that there is so much information that you don't know. You may figure out a solution to one problem, but then suddenly, another problem arises, and you're left with more answers to search for. Your adrenaline rushes, you're slightly frustrated, you're a little anxious but also excited. This has been a familiar feeling to me my entire life. Now you're probably wondering what exactly do I mean right? Well let me explain.

I grew up as a curious person and from a very young age I was drawn to the concept of a challenge. One of the most challenging activities I have ever participated or trained in has been the martial arts. This is a hobby that takes many years of consistent practice. It's all hard work, blood, sweat, and tears. When you think you're good you always encounter someone who is better or has been practicing longer than you so of course they have more experience. Every time I go and train and participate in tournaments, I feel all the emotions that I've described to you in the previous paragraph.  

Learning to code or being a software developer (yes, I'm starting to identify as a developer) has been one of the most challenging things I have ever stumbled across. It's another skill that pushes me to my mental limits and I look at it as a skill that I hone and practice every day that makes me slightly better than I was the day before. That's what martial arts has been to me and now this is what coding has become to me. I haven't been coding that long. In fact, I started practicing with online tutorials and free coding websites on and off about 7 months ago. I've always known about programming languages and the technology industry because many of my close friends have always been involved in it, so I've had exposure to it my entire life, but never decided to pursue it. The moment I decided to really start coding was the moment I realized that this challenge and this lifestyle as a developer is well suited for me no matter how difficult it may get. I took the plunge! now I'm at Flatiron and I don't intend on stopping my coding journey.
